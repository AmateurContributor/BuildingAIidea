# Project title
Forecasting visitors on a local gym

## Summary
The idea for an AI application is to use and train data such as user logins, weather, public holidays and use history to create a forecasting application for the local gym's users

## Background:
I have not yet seen a working forecast application. Most gyms do not have any forecasting applications and the ones that do do not account for important factors such as weather or public holidays etc. Thus, the problems that the AI application would solve are:

* users needing information about user frequency at the gym
* forecasting and suggesting suitable times for gym usage depending on the users' preferences

## How to use the application
The application would ideally be downloadable to e.g. mobile phones where users can log in with their gym ID. If the gym already has an applciation, the AI solution would be integrated to be a part of it. Users do not have to separately know how to use it apart from choosing their desired date for forecast. The application would be limited to show forecasts for e.g. the upcoming 7 days.

## Data sources and AI methods
The application would use data from gym visitations history (recorded each time when a user arrives and signs to the gym with a key card), weather forecasts and public holidays and seasons.

The application would use machine learning of these datasets to make conclusions of the gym users' behaviour and usage preferences.

## Challenges
To create accurate forecasts with possibly little and certainly limited data. Gym usage can be hard to forecast as it can vary greatly without reason. Naturally, it can be argued that more people visit in January than July, but on a day-to-day level the usage can vary significantly, which can be confusing to the AI or users seeing the forecasts.
